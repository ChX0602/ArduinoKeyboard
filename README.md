# ArduinoKeyboard

This piece of program converts a CVS file into code that runs on Arduino boards that supports the "Keyboard" library, such as Arduino Leonardo. So that we can "replay" the keystrokes recorded in a file repeteddly many times to study the pattern.

To do that, simply run the main function, and choose source CVS from the UI, and paste the code generated into Arduino IDE.
