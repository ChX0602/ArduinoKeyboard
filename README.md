# ArduinoKeyboard

This piece of program converts a CSV file into code that runs on Arduino boards that supports the "Keyboard" library, such as Arduino Leonardo. So that we can "replay" the keystrokes recorded in a file repetedly many times to study the pattern.

To do that, simply run the main function, choose source CVS from the UI, and paste the code generated into Arduino IDE.

The CSV file format follows the sample on the project webpage.
